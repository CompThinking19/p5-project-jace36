So, for this project, I was originally going to draw a kirby figure using javascript. I thought that would be simple enough since Kirby is a simple character design (and everyone loves Kirby)
But, I didn't really think that was interactive enough, which gave me the idea to have a kirby flying gif and have the user decide where it would go
I also wanted to use a real background from the Kirby games to make it like the user is actually playing part of the game.
For my first time using Javascript, I felt like it was a really successful mini project.
Especially since it took a lot of work to figure out how to do it all, since I had a lot of problems at making the background image show at first.
For some reason when I first tried to get the background image, it kept showing up but it wasn't visible. But, I found a way to make visible.
For a simple project, it was rather difficult to get it all to work.
